    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This program attempts to recreate the paper and pencil game 'hangman' in a program with the langauge python. In the game of hangman, one must guess each character of a unknown word within a certain amount of guesses, or else the player will lose. Each wrong guess adds an element of a hanging man to the gallows, and if the hanging man is fully completed, then the game ends with the player losing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts by asking the user which database they would like to use for the random word to be picked from. A number is expected here, and if the input is neither 1 or 2, then 1 is defaulted. Afterwards, program asks what difficulty, easy, medium, or hard, to play on. The harder the difficulty, the less tries one has before they lose. Medium is the default diffulty. Initially, this was supposed to be a hanged man, but drawing one out was difficult, so a tracker that keeps count of your tries was used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to which database and difficulty the user would like, a hint can also be playing throughout the time the user is guessing the word. If not given an explicit no, the program will default to yes, and a song will be playing in the background. This song is either from the artist the user is trying to guess, or from the artist of the song the user is trying to guess. Varying difficulties will result in different songs, as the harder the difficulty, the harder the hint song will be. The songs chosen for the hints were based off of how popular it is relative to the artist's other songs and also how many featuring artists there were on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can then start guessing characters to figure out the word. Only characters should be guessed, as if a full string was guessed, the program will interpret it as guessing the whole word. If. If one wanted to figure out the word without guessing it, they could enter an empty string which auto completes the unknown word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The progress of the word and a list of incorrect guesses is printed after every guess. A list of wrong guesses is only printed if there exists a wrong guess. The program stops depending on which of these 2 conditions is met first, the user uses up all their wrong guesses, or they correctly guess the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user ends up winning, the song they guessed or from the respective artist starts playing, and can be ended along side the program when the user types anything."
